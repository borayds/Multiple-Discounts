# Multiple-Discounts

Calculating Multiple Discounts with C#

Sometimes companies offer double or multiple discounts. While calculating, this doesnâ€™t mean you get the sum of these percentages. For instance, if you get 50%+50% discount, this doesnâ€™t mean you can get the product for free ðŸ˜„. Itâ€™s because you get the second discount over the subtracted amount of first discount.

Letâ€™s say the product costs $400. When you have first 50% discount, it makes $200. With the second %50 discount, now it makes $100 which is equivalent of %75 discount in total.

Thatâ€™s a small marketing trick by the companies, trying to show the discount looks much more.

You may have as many discounts as you like on your app. I hope this gives you the idea.
